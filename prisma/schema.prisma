/// 3.1 Application models should be defined inside the Prisma schema using the so-called Prisma models
/// 3.1 Those models represent the entities of our application and are defined by the model blocks inside the schema.prisma file 
/// 3.1 Each block contains several fields representing the data for each entity

/// 3.1 We usually write the model's name using PascalCase and in the singular form
/// 3.1 all fields are required by default unless you add the ? type modifier

/// 3.1 @id field attribute, specifying that this is the table's primary key
/// 3.1 the @default(cuid()) attribute sets a default CUID value to it, so we don't need to set the id value ourselves when we create records, and it makes sure each record has a unique id value.
/// 3.1 we can also use uuid() that is generated by the system but not related to any specific data. cuid() is data specific.
/// 3.1 other attribute functions: autoincrement()
/// 3.1 https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference

/// 3.1 The @updatedAt attribute automatically stores, much like the now() function, the time when a record was last updated. 
/// 3.1 If we don't set a time ourselves, the Prisma Client will automatically set the value for the updatedAt field with this attribute.
